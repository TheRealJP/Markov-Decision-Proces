# Markov Decision Proces 

## About
The robotics code can be found in my "[AI-Driven-Robot-Simulation](https://github.com/TheRealJonathanPeers/AI-Driven-Robot-Simulation)" repo.

Used Markov Decision Proces (MDP) to solve the Open AI Gym frozenlake problem (https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/).
The trained model was used to generate a route trough the maze. 
This output was exported in a .csv file that we could use to guide the robot trough the gazebo maze simulation.https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/

Everything is written in Python 3.
